# framer-motion-playground
Framer Motion looks like a very promising library for quick and robust CSS Animations. This is just a playground repo where I play around with different Framer Motion components to see how they work. At the same time, I hope this repo helps someone who is also starting out with Framer Motion. 

## How to use this repo
In the main branch, you can see just a single div with class-name `box`. You can clone this, and apply different properties on this div to see what they do. I am creating different branches to try out different features. Every branch would be an example of how to do something e.g. a branch to show an animated navbar etc.
