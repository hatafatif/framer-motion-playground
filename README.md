# framer-motion-playground
Framer Motion looks like a very promising library for quick and robust CSS Animations. This is just a playground repo where I play around with different Framer Motion components to see how they work. At the same time, I hope this repo helps someone who is also starting out with Framer Motion. I am following the Framer Motion documentation, as well as TheNetNinja's Youtube series on this.
